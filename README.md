## lawuna-Mobile-application
<<<<<<< HEAD
Is an android camera application for detecting macro contaminants (such as plastic bottles and polythene bags) along the shores of fresh water bodies using the device's back camera. With the help of a custom built pre-trained YOLO v4 model trained on MS COCO[https://cocodataset.org/] dataset that is retrained using transfer learning into a custom object detection model that is converted into tensorFlow[https://www.tensorflow.org/] then quantized tensorFlow lite[https://www.tensorflow.org/lite] format and uses data from a custom dataset of images collected from the shores of lake Victoria.
This repository walks you through how to setup and build the lawuna mobile application on your local machine.
